# Reference Architecture

Reference architecture is a holistic set of guidelines for building and deploying SBE solutions using AWS services. These are used to help design, implement, and manage SBE solutions that align with AWS recommended practices.

As reference architectures are added to the SBE Design & Build Hub, they will appear here with documentation, examples, and tutorials. This section will contain general reference architectures, applicable across a variety of verticals, and additional industry-specific reference architecture will be available within the [Industries](../industries/index.md) section of this site.
