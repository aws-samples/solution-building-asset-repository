# IoT Assets

IoT assets  are building blocks for IoT-specific solutions. Builders can use them as a starting point for building a solution or add them to an existing solution as a means of optimization. 

As assets are added to the Solution Building Asset Repository, they will appear here with documentation, examples, and tutorials.
