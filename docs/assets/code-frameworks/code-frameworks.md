# Code & Frameworks

Code and Frameworks is a curated collection of building blocks for software developers and designers. This comprehensive toolbox includes security scanners, UX frameworks, and other resources to streamline development, boost productivity, enhance safety, and expedite product shipping. With these assets, teams can leverage pre-built components, libraries, and frameworks to save time, increase efficiency, and deliver secure, top-notch software products.

As assets are built, they will be added here with complete documentation and examples.
