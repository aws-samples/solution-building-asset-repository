This AWS Solution is an add-on that works with AWS Security Hub and provides predefined response and remediation actions based on industry compliance standards and best practices for security threats. It helps Security Hub customers to resolve common security findings and to improve their security posture in AWS.

This AWS Solution creates playbooks for customers to individually choose what they want to deploy in their Security Hub admin account. Each playbook contains the necessary actions to start the remediation workflow within the admin account or any member account.
