# Well Architected Lens

AWS Well-Architected Pillars help cloud architects build secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure for a variety of applications and workloads.

The [AWS Well-Architected Tool](https://aws.amazon.com/well-architected-tool/) makes it easy to create Custom Lenses by providing a json template that you can use. The template outlines how the lens content must be defined, and it controls how the lens is presented within the AWS WA Tool.

[AWS Well-Architected Lenses](https://github.com/aws-samples/custom-lens-wa-hub/tree/main) extend the guidance offered by AWS Well-Architected to specific industry and technology domains, such as machine learning (ML), data analytics, serverless, high performance computing (HPC), IoT, SAP, streaming media, the games industry, hybrid networking, and financial services. To fully evaluate workloads, use applicable lenses together with the AWS Well-Architected Framework and its six pillars.
