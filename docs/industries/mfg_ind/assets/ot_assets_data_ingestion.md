## Guidance for Connecting On-Premises Operational Technology Assets to AWS Cloud for Robust Data Ingestion 
This AWS Solution provides operational technology (OT) managers with secure machine and industrial equipment connectivity to the AWS Cloud. This solution automatically deploys and configures AWS IoT Greengrass and provides integration with AWS IoT SiteWise. You can then publish machine and industrial asset telemetry data to AWS IoT SiteWise and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), populating an industrial data lake with machine telemetry to support insights through visualization, analytics, and machine learning. This solution supports both the OPC Data Access (OPC-DA) and OPC Unified Architecture (OPC-UA) protocols, and supports streaming time series data through the OSIsoft PI Web API.
