# Technical Assets for Industries

Technical Assets for Industries is a curated collection of industry-specific building blocks. Each asset in this collection is tailored to the needs, challenges, and goals of a particular industry. They can be used independently or in conjunction with one another to build a new solution or to raise the quality bar of an existing solution.

As technical assets are developed, they will be added here with documentation, examples, and tutorials.
