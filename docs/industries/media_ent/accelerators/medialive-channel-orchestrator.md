# AWS MediaLive Channel Orchestrator

*This accelerator contains sample code to deploy a web app that can be used to simplify the management of AWS MediaLive Channels*

[AWS Elemental MediaLive](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/medialive/) is a real-time video service that lets you create live outputs for broadcast and streaming delivery. You use MediaLive to transform live video content from one format and package into other formats and packages. You typically need to transform the content in order to provide a format and package that a playback device can handle. Playback devices include smartphones and set-top boxes attached to televisions.
