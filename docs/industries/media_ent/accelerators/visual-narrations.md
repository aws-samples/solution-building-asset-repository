# Social Media Stories and Visual Narrations with Amazon Polly and AWS Elemental MediaConvert

*This accelerator deploys a sample stack to illustrate how you can turn articles into videos by using a fully automated editorial workflow built using AWS services*

This accelerator uses [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/), [Amazon Polly](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/), [AWS Elemental MediaConvert](https://aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/), and [Amazon Comprehend](https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/) to provide an overview of how you can turn articles into videos by using a fully automated editorial workflow built using AWS services.

Read a blogpost that guides the implementation of this accelerator [here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/media/how-to-turn-articles-into-videos-using-aws-elemental-mediaconvert-and-amazon-polly/) and then clone the associated repository [here](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-elemental-mediaconvert-visual-narrations)
