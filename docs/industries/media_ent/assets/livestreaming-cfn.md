# Livestreaming CloudFormation template

*This asset provides an explanation of how to use CloudFormation for automating live streaming and provides a sample template and documentation references for those new to CloudFormation.*

To build an end-to-end, live video streaming workflow with AWS, you typically begin by setting up each of the required [AWS Media Services](https://aws.amazon.com/media-services/) through the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/). The console is a great tool to explore all the features each Media Service offers, and the settings you can enable, disable, or tweak as you put all the pieces together. However, once you set up the resources exactly as you want, you may find it tedious to use the console to replicate your setup in other Regions, or recreating a previous workflow for another event. Automating this process, and only using the console to make minor changes to resources generated by your automation, may be the best way to work.

This asset is an article explaining how to automate live video streaming workflows on AWS using CloudFormation templates, which allow you to define and replicate Media Services like MediaLive and MediaStore across regions. It analyzes a sample CloudFormation template that sets up a basic live streaming workflow with a MediaStore container, MediaLive HLS input, and single-pipeline MediaLive channel. The template resources correspond to those you would configure in the AWS console, so by automating with CloudFormation you can avoid repetitive manual setup.
