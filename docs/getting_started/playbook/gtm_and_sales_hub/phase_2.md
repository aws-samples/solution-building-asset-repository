# Phase 2: Launch

Launch is a time for us to celebrate all the work we have done so far and get in front of customers and prospects publicly to share the transformation potential of the partner solution. Execution is the key at this Phase. Assuming our content, messaging, and strategy in the Pre-Launch phase were correct, this is where we make fine-tuned adjustments based on feedback from a broader set of customers. These steps in this phase focus on the announcement itself, execution of plans, and a 60-day milestone to confirm that our assumptions from Pre-Launch are playing out as expected.

### Listing
Every solution will have a different listing path based on how to get the solution into customers’ hands best. This could be on a partner’s discovery channels, the AWS Marketplace, or through a distributor channel. Below are the AWS listing sites:

- AWS Marketplace, which requires Marketplace validation for listing
- AWS Solution Library, which requires a FTR and the creation of a GTM package (at a minimum, industry requirements vary)
- Partner Solution Finder, which lists solutions from partners above Registered status

### Announcement
Launch is supported by outbound announcements to draw attention to and drive momentum for a Solution Building Guidance solution. Marketing should be aligned to a multi-media announcement approach for maximum impact.

### Marketing Execution
Once you have worked with your partner to launch their Solution Building Guidance solution, it’s important to put that story to the test for the customers to see and hear through planned events, campaigns, and activities. The marketing plan built in Pre-Launch should include all activities that are carried out to achieve awareness, generate demand and leads and fill the pipeline with opportunities. This Phase executes the marketing plan to ensure the steps are accomplishing the plan.

| Summits and Events | Participation in summit and events, as appropriate. | PDM and SM to identify key 1P and 3P events to participate in. |

### Launch Outcomes
Once this Phase has been completed, the stakeholders should regroup to discuss a 60-day post-launch review. A key piece of Solution Building Guidance is that we want to build solutions that don’t sit on the shelf. If solutions are not driving the expected customer interest, this is an excellent time to reassess and reevaluate our progress. If improvements are needed, pause ongoing Post-Launch work, make course corrections, and retest progress.
