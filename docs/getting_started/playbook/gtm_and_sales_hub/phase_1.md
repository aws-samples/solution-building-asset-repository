### Planning

Proper planning helps set our solution goals, ensures expectations are aligned, and assigns clear owners for each marketing and sales task. These plans are developed based on the GTM workshop and Kickoff output. Plans are living documents that should be referred to often and updated as we gather more customer data, as market conditions evolve, and as we expand offerings into new markets.

| Task | Description | Instructions |
| ----- | ----------- | ------ |
| Marketing Plan | Create marketing plan based on marketing kickoff, customer, market segment, etc., that align to KPIs set out for solution. | Determine the GTM team, engagement model. |
| Solution Discovery Plan | Describe how product/solution will be discovered. | Sales/product collateral repositories for internal and external information. |
| GTM Objectives and Stakeholders | At a glance overview of objectives, stakeholders, and tracking. | With the GTM plan identify top objectives, stakeholders, and role and responsibilities. |
| GTM Plan | Map out holistic GTM approach. For each sales persona, create an enablement plan including how will they made aware of the product and sales strategy. | This plan is created as a result of the GTM workshop. |
| Message testing with pilot/MLP customers | Message testing: messaging workshop all GTM stakeholders. Customers can help us understand the strength of our messaging. This outreach to pilot customers allows us to adapt messaging before reaching a broader audience at launch. | Schedule messaging survey discussions with pilot customers, as available. |

### Asset Creation
Assets are used to engage with customers/prospects, sellers, and prospective partners that might be able to collaborate on solution enhancements. The partner may have existing assets that should be cataloged and reviewed for reuse. This is not an exhaustive list, yet not all assets are required. Assets can also be added over time; this is especially valuable as new customer successes are released.

To ensure AWS and partner sellers have the tools to take a solution to market, the Field Ready Kit (FRK) should be built for each solution.

The FRK includes:

1. **Sales Brief**: Two-page document for AWS account teams to quickly understand the partner's core value proposition to AWS customers and AWS.
2. **Solution Brief**: Two-page customer-facing resource that is the partner's tool to motivate and inspire customers to purchase or seek more information regarding their offering on AWS.
3. **Sales Deck**: Presentation designed to educate the AWS account teams on the partner solution's core value proposition to AWS customers and AWS, common sales scenarios and use cases, target customer market segment(s) and buyer roles, sales cycle, customer success, deployment options, and call-to-action content and resources.
4. **First Call Deck**: Presentation used to articulate the value AWS customers can derive by leveraging your solution.

<br>

| Task | Description | Instructions |
| ----- | ----------- | ------ |
| First Call Deck | Presentation used to articulate the value AWS customers can derive by leveraging the partner’s solution. It includes information to introduce the partner's offerings on AWS, including a solution overview, industry trends, customers’ business needs, core business scenarios, AWS + partner alignment, case studies, and calls-to-action, including a technical addendum with more technical depth, including reference architecture, if applicable. It can be used as a quick reference by the AWS account teams or as a tool to help guide them through a first call with a potential customer. | Create customer-facing version. |
| Sales Brief | Two-page document for AWS account teams to quickly understand the partner's core value proposition to AWS customers and AWS, common sales scenarios and use cases, target customer market segment(s) and buyer roles, similar solutions in the market, customer success, strategic partner benefits, deployment options, and available resources to use when they've identified a potential co-selling opportunity. | Create 2 pager summarizing the customer use cases, solution value prop, and commercial model to be used by APO and Global Services sellers. |
| Solution Brief | A two-page customer-facing resource that is a partner's tool to motivate and inspire customers to purchase or seek more information regarding their offering on AWS. It should remind the customer of what was discussed or presented to them. This is not a data sheet highlighting the technical aspects or features that make the solution work. This is the “why,” with only a cursory mention of “how.” They will likely need deeper content, which they can follow up with later. | Create leave-behind for the customer highlighting the product features. |
| APN Blog | Blog to highlight solution launch. | Write blog with SM or other approved AWS blogger. |
| Social Media | Organic or paid social media promotion. | Partner and PDM/PMM to create social media assets announcing solution. |

| Webinar live or on demand | Live or pre-recorded webinar to promote solution. | Record or schedule live webinar broadcast to drive demand and awareness of LoB solution. |
| Solution Demo | Virtual or physical demo to showcase solution attributes. | Create demo. |
| eBook | eBook highlighting solution and value prop/key messages. | Partner (and/or AWS) to create eBook on solution. |
| Pilot case studies or references | Customer successes | Complete case studies with end customers as a part of the sales pitches. |

### Sales Enablement
It is important to discuss enablement and add any steps that might accelerate understanding of the solution and the value of being built with Solution Building Guidance and on AWS.

| Task | Description | Instructions |
| ----- | ----------- | ------ |
| Demo videos | Pre-recorded demos of the solution for Sellers. | Create demo videos for inclusion at events, website, etc. |
| Coordinate Sales and Delivery Training | Structured learning paths based on audience. | Pre-requisite: Use case is "published" and prioritized for field GTM through Alchemy, and solution messaging has been reviewed/approved by your IMM/PMM. |
| Launch Announcement | Launch Announcement for AWS Sellers. | Partner and PDM to create Launch announcement including one minute webinar, customer story, key messages. |

### Account Mapping
Co-selling, or sharing and collaborating on leads and opportunities, increases the number of leads/opportunities shared between AWS and a partner. Co-selling fosters collaboration across teams, communicating the combined value to the customer, providing better customer outcomes, and assuring mutual commitment from AWS and Partners. Co-selling accelerates when there is a qualified opportunity for AWS and the partner to work together. AWS and partner combine demand generation efforts to create leads that qualify into opportunities.

Once appropriate AWS Sellers are identified (by industry, region, or service family), a PDM can organize Account Mapping with the AWS Seller team. This will help coordinate outreach across a targeted list of accounts, create a plan of outreach between the partner and AWS account teams (PSM/ISM/AMs), and build a pipeline that is reviewed regularly to provide governance, visibility, coaching, alignment, remove blockers, allocate ownership, track GTM activities, build a new pipeline, and define next steps together as a team.

| Task | Description | Instructions |
| ----- | ----------- | ------ |
| Account Mapping Plan | Identify your account map with AWS Sellers. | The following steps should be followed for account mapping: <br> 1. Set up weekly or bi-weekly pipeline call. <br> 2. Get targeted list of accounts from the partner. <br> 3. Leverage data to break down the partner footprint within each of these identified accounts. <br> 4. Map the partner account teams to the AWS sales team. <br> 5. Identify the partner solutions that will be propositioned within each account. <br> 6. Identify 10-30 accounts to target first. <br> 7. Build out broader campaigns (by footprint) to help start the conversations within the list of target accounts. <br> 8. Tag opportunities with a campaign code. |
| Partner Account Plan | Build out Partner Account Plan for PO opportunity growth. | PDM to map out Partner Account Plan with partner. |
| Pipeline Review | Regularly scheduled review of pipeline. | A pipeline review call aims to provide governance, visibility, coaching, alignment, remove blockers, allocate ownership, track GTM activities, build a new pipeline, and define the next steps with a partner. <br><br> This call should be held weekly or bi-weekly with the partner and PDM. Sales and alliance resources should be invited to these discussions to attend as possible. |

### Pre-Launch Outcomes
Once this Phase of work has been completed, you are ready to announce the availability of your Solution Building Guidance solution. Sellers are already driving opportunity creation with the targeted list of accounts. Your partner has a holistic marketing and GTM strategy for the solution. A comprehensive set of marketing assets supports this to drive interest in the solution.
