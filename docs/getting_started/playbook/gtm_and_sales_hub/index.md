# Go-to-Market and Sales Hub

This GTM and Sales Hub, Playbook, and the supporting checklist, map out activities along the GTM life cycle of a solution. Each section includes steps and instructions to maximize your GTM and Sales efforts. 

A GTM strategy includes all the activities to introduce a new solution into the market. The GTM and Sales Hub motions include all the activities executed to create customer demand and sales opportunities.

The outcome of successfully completing the GTM and Sales Hub is a launched solution that is being marketed, sold, and tracked for performance. There are three phases in the GTM and Sales Hub, which are designed to be completed sequentially:

- **Pre-Launch** includes all the work to get your solution ready for market

- **Launch** means you are in market! Celebrate the milestone with a big marketing push to make sure potential customers can learn about the solution offering.

- **Post-Launch** is for all the motions to grow once your solution has launched

The steps in the Hub span three main focus areas:

1. Marketing: Content planning and preparation for solution launch, including market/customer identification, messaging, asset creation (content, blogs, case studies, FCD, webinar), marketing and launch plan, announcement, goal and KPI setting and tracking, and sales enablement.
2. Go-to-Market: Execution of the marketing and launch plans, demand generation activities, customer success, account-based marketing, and events.
3. Selling: Execution of Account plans with jointly identified customers, nurturing of PSQLs, outreach to key customer profiles, and opportunity creation along with performance tracking.
