### Customer Success
Line-of-Business customers will want to hear from existing customers, and AWS Sellers want to have confidence that other customers are using a solution and that it works as expected. Customers are the ideal marketing asset for campaigns. Below are instructions on creating customer case studies, and success stories.

| Case Studies | Having a customer story that speaks to the scenario, problem, solution, benefits to the customer, and any cost savings is critical in validating the solution and earning trust with our AWS Sellers. | Find details on how to submit a formal partner case study to be published on the AWS Partner Solution Finder can be found on the APN Case Study Wiki. |


### Selling
Sales alignment will continue to meet the needs of customers throughout the life of a solution. The PDM and partner should continue to reach new targets based on continued customer feedback.

| Task | Description | Instructions |
| ----- | ----------- | ------ |
| Continued Sales Alignment | Developing sales campaigns helps us work better with our partners to create new opportunities and build pipelines. It focuses the sales activities on a defined scope and a concrete goal and provides supporting instruction and collateral. Leveraging all the AWS resources available from an industry, vertical, or workload perspective is essential when developing a sales play or campaign. | Sales plays/campaigns will differ between Consulting, Technology, Distribution, and ISV partners, and the AWS teams that should be engaged will also be different. Working with the AWS Strategic BD team will be imperative when creating an industry-specific campaign. In addition to working with our AWS industry and workload specialist teams, alignment with segment teams (i.e., SMB Partner Team or Global Segment ISV Team) will be important to incorporate into a campaign depending upon the type of partner that you manage (Technology, Consulting, or Distribution Partner). Alignment between the technical, specialist, segment, marketing, and business-minded teams is essential to the success of any campaign. |


### Post-Launch Outcomes
The outcome of this Phase is the end of life or relaunching of a solution, as GTM and Selling will continue throughout the life of a solution. Post Launch motions will overlap with Solution Lifecycle Management (SLM) and we can adjust our marketing and GTM efforts according to the feedback through our reporting mechanisms in the SLM Hub.
