# Solution Lifecycle Management Hub

Solution lifecycle management spans across Build and GTM/Sales Hubs and is active for the entire lifespan of a solution. This ensures that the solution stays relevant through its shelf life. It provides essential opportunities to re-evaluate the impact of prior Post Launch activities and assess new activities. A very important aspect is an active feedback loop from customers, partners, and AWS to drive continuous improvement as it matures in the market. It includes decisions to retire solutions that no longer drive value for and adoption by new customers.

### Build
The Build component of lifecycle management is an event-driven process managed through automated and manual mechanisms such as validation status and feedback received. For example, FTRs for a Solution and its components expire every 24 months. At that time, they will go through the FTR process for revalidation again. This ensures that potentially new risks can be identified and remediated, as necessary. AWS Partners can track the validation status of their offerings and solutions in their [Partner Scorecard](https://partnercentral.awspartner.com/partnercentral2/s/) in AWS Partner Central, including notification of upcoming expirations.

> Note: The required revalidation cycle of a solution can also be leveraged as a force function for a lifecycle checkpoint by regrouping the partner, PDM, and SM to evaluate the performance of a solution against its customer-driven KPIs.


### GTM and Sales
The GTM/Sales component of the solution lifecycle management consists of the ongoing Post Launch activities (reporting, ongoing marketing, customer success, selling) throughout the lifespan of the solution.
