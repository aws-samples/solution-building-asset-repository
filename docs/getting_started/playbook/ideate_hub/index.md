# Ideate Hub Overview

The Ideate Hub is the first of four solution development Hubs. In this Hub, we gather and evaluate customer insights to better understand customer needs and innovate ideas to solve customer challenges. Through the ideation process, we create the vision for the solution and map the end to end customer experience. In the final stages of ideation, the proposed solution is tested, refined and the definition and metrics of success are developed.

The goal of the Ideate Hub is to obtain the right information needed at the beginning of the solution development process in order to make the most optimized decisions across the solution development stages. Our process of Working Backwards from the customer helps to create the foundation for innovative solution ideation and is Amazon’s process of discovery and invention that delivers successful customer business outcomes. The Ideate Hub reduces costly rework and saves time in subsequent solution development stages because we design with the customer in mind from the beginning, creating a solid foundation on which Solution Building Guidance builds a business outcome solution reducing the time to value and time to market for our customers. Ideate Hub Self-Service is designed to allow partners to develop solution offerings on their own schedule. The time required to complete each phase will vary depending upon the partner, solution scope and complexity, funding, and business priorities.

## The Ideate Hub Experience
In the Ideate Hub, partners will be introduced to a foundation of successful solution ideation, including how customer obsession drives innovation and actual use case application. After completing the foundational learning series, partners will experience “Working Backwards from your Customer” to begin the process of solution ideation by answering the 5 Customer Questions and completing the solution Press Release and Frequently Asked Questions document (PR FAQ).  The working backwards exercise can be completed on your own or with your team. Partners who complete the Working Backwards exercise can also sign up to be invited to an AWS Partner Matchmaking event and review solution funding options and resources.
