Working Backwards is **Amazon’s process of discovery and invention that delivers customer delight**. Working Backwards is how we stay customer obsessed — we work backwards from the moment that the product, service or experience is in a customer’s hands. The Working Backwards framework can be used for big and small inventions alike, and for external or internal customers.

**Working Backwards involves five stages**: Listen, Define, Invent, Refine, and Test & Iterate. Each Working Backwards stage aligns to the 5 Customer Questions and a set of recommended actions. Discover the definitions, importance, and what to do in each stage below.
