# Phase 4: Publishing / Delivery
Publishing triggers the publication of the Solution in the AWS Partner Discovery Tools, AWS Solution Library, and AWS Marketplace (optional) to allow customers to discover and purchase Solutions. Publishing will be initiated through the GTM and Sales Hub based on solution launch readiness.

Depending on the composition of the Solution, it will be published as a Software listing (SaaS) or as a Services listing. Solutions that are composed of one or multiple offerings from one or multiple partners will be published as a Services listing with a designated lead partner (typically GSI/SI) to provide customers with a single point of contact/ownership for the Solution.
