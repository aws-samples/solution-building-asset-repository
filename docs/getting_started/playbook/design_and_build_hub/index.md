# Design and Build Hub

The Build Hub provides AWS Partners and AWS technical resources access to build tools, Open Source code, guidance, and testing mechanisms to help accelerate partner solution builds while meeting consistent quality bars. The Partner Solution Technology Team is responsible for the curation and onboarding assets, accelerators, guidance, and tooling.

It provides everything needed to get started building, enhancing, and maintaining solutions. This would consist of the following components:

1. Architectural patterns and best practices
2. Templates and code examples, such as CloudFormation templates and CDK (Cloud Development Kit) examples
3. Source code and solution assets for existing published solutions
4. SDKs and developer toolchains, plugins, and more for quick integration with AWS services, including hardware-based solutions
5. Technical guidance and documentation for solution development

The outcome of successfully completing the Design and Build Hub is a validated solution ready for launch and Go-to-Market support. There are five phases in the Design and Build Hub, which are designed to be completed sequentially:

- **Phase 0** is Build Engagement and Initiation

- **Phase 1** is Design

- **Phase 2** is Build

- **Phase 3** is Validation

- **Phase 4** is Publishing

## Design and Build Hub Assets
Solution Building Guidance is designed to allow partners to develop solution offerings on their own schedule. The time required to complete each phase will vary depending upon the partner, solution scope and complexity, funding, and business priorities.
