# Phase 3: Validation

Phase 3 is designed to ensure that a solution and its components meet a quality bar that delivers a consistent customer experience. At the end of this phase, the solution and its components have completed all required validations. This enables publishing in the discovery tools by meeting the required quality bars.

### Foundational Technical Review (FTR)
FTRs help identify and mitigate technical risks for AWS Partners and the AWS Partner Network on behalf of AWS customers. The FTR focuses on a subset of AWS Well-Architected best practices and defines each requirement's objective pass/fail criteria. This helps AWS Partners prioritize implementing the controls critical to customer success and creates a standard bar that can be applied to thousands of partners consistently.

The FTR process evaluates a partner offering against a Validation Checklist (VCL). If issues are identified, a report is sent detailing the necessary remediations. Once there are no outstanding issues, the FTR is approved. For more details on the review, please see the FTR process page.

#### FTR vs. Well-Architected Framework (WAFR)
The FTR differs from the WAFR in two key ways:

- Its scope is significantly narrower, focusing on a subset of best practices from the Security, Reliability, and Operational Excellence pillars
- It provides a much more specific and objective standard for evaluation

This helps scale the FTR so we can provide a consistent validation experience for thousands or even tens of thousands of Partner offerings through a self-service modality. The FTR is not intended to be a replacement for a full WAFR. We require partners to conduct a self-review across the entire Well-Architected Framework as part of completing a partner-hosted FTR.

### AWS Solution Quality Bar
Managed by WWSO, the AWS Solution Library is the central external repository for solutions with >200 solutions spanning a range of technology and industry use cases. A solution addresses a customer use case on AWS through a combination of technical assets (e.g., application code, managed software, reference architecture) supported by consulting assets and services (for example, design, build, and support). Solutions automate and reduce the number of decisions customers need to make to address their business and technical use cases on AWS, given the breadth and depth of services and partner offerings and various ways these can be put together.

The AWS Solution Library requires that AWS Partner Solutions meet the AWS Solution Quality Bar.


> Note: AWS Solution Library currently only supports the listing of Software based solutions. The listing of Solutions delivered by an SI/GSI as a lead partner is currently not supported.
