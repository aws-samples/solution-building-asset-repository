# GenAI Accelerator

GenAI Assets are building blocks for GenAI specific solutions. Builders can use them as a starting point for building a solution or add them to an existing solution as a means of optimization. Assets can be put together to create accelerators but are not a complete solution without the inclusion of additional components.

As assets are added to the SBE Design & Build Hub, they will appear here with documentation, examples, and tutorials.
