## Building with Amazon Bedrock and LangChain

### Amazon Bedrock  
is a fully managed service for using foundation models. It allows you to access models from Amazon and third parties with a single set of APIs for both text generation and image generation.

In this workshop, we will use LangChain to build generative AI prototypes with Amazon Bedrock. We will proceed through a series of labs aimed at different skill levels from beginner to intermediate. We will learn how to use the capabilities of the libraries and models to build prototypes for a wide range of use cases.

### LangChain  
provides convenient functions for interacting with Amazon Bedrock's models and related services like vector databases. LangChain offers Python and JavaScript libraries. For this workshop, we will use the Python version of LangChain.

### Streamlit  
allows us to quickly create web front ends for our Python code, without needing front-end development skills. Streamlit is great for creating proofs-of-concepts that can be presented to a wide audience of both technical and non-technical people.

Once you have completed the Prerequisites sections, you can complete the labs in any order.
