_High availability is the ability of an application or service to remain accessible and operational without interruption for extended periods of time, achieved through features like regions, availability zones, and automated scaling and recovery mechanisms. It ensures that customers can rely on continuous and reliable access to their resources, minimizing downtime and maximizing uptime._
