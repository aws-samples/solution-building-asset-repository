# Product Carbon Footprinting on AWS
This Guidance helps customers scale product carbon footprint (PCF) tracking, reduce the manual effort involved with data collection and calculation, and provide transparent and auditable PCFs for reporting. The architecture pairs Internet of Things (IoT) sensor data from a manufacturing facility with product information and emission factors. An interactive dashboard uses this data to track product-level energy and carbon footprint in addition to benchmarking environmental performance across equipment and sites. With this Guidance, customers can identify hotspots and best practices to lower their PCF and manufacturing costs.

# Geospatial Insights for Sustainability on AWS
This Guidance helps customers observe land use changes using geospatial data to support supply chain best practices. Customers can monitor changes in forest density using an Amazon SageMaker geospatial capability that simplifies the process of analyzing satellite images for changes in vegetation. Results are stored, cataloged, and observable on Amazon QuickSight for customers to review.

# Electric Vehicle Battery Health Prediction on AWS
This Guidance demonstrates how to use historical battery health data with artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) algorithms to improve the accuracy of battery State of Health (SoH) and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimations. Currently, these estimations largely rely on a static formula-based approach, which can provide near-term battery health information. Using this Guidance, automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) can predict battery SoH and RUL into the future with easy-to-train AI/ML models built using historical data stored in the Cloud.
