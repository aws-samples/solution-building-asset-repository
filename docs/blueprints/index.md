# Blueprints

Blueprint is pre-built, pre-validated implementation guide for building solutions. The customers aren't necessarily aware of a Blueprint used in a solution. The solutions implementing the Blueprints are either enhanced or modified to meet one or more Blueprints' implementation guidelines. Blueprints are not high-level reference architectures. Blueprints are tested against their expected outcomes. The output of a Blueprint could be an implementation guide or a deployable solution to enhance an existing solution.

As blueprints are added to the SBE Design & Build Hub, they will appear here with documentation, examples, and tutorials.
