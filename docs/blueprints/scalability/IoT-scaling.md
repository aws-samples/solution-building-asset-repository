IoT Services Scaling (\<limits\>)

**AWS IoT Core**

AWS IoT Core can communicate with connected devices securely, with low latency and with low overhead. The communication can scale to as many devices as you want. AWS IoT Core supports standard communication protocols (HTTP, MQTT, and WebSockets and LoRaWAN are supported currently). Communication is secured using TLS.

**Device Gateway**

The Device Gateway forms the backbone of communication between connected devices and the cloud capabilities such as the Rules Engine, Device Shadow, and other AWS and 3rd-party services.
