# SBE Blueprints
Solution Building Enablement (SBE) Blueprints are a bar raising implementation guide to enhance the existing solution with a specific functionality. SBE Blueprint when implemented, it enhances the solution to meet a set of requirements at production scale. The SBE Build Hub team collaborates with the specializations like Data, AI & ML and various other teams to create Blueprints. Partners building SBE solutions would implement the SBE Blueprints in their solution building process. Any solution building engagement that is following SBE can use one or more SBE Blueprints in their solution building journey. The output of a SBE Blueprint could include deployment templates built in CFN, terraform, etc or it could be a detailed implementation guideline that is pre-validate.
