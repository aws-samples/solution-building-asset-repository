# Glossary

### Assets
Assets are building blocks for solutions. Builders can use them as a starting point for building a solution or add them to an existing solution as a means of optimization. Assets can be put together to create accelerators but are not a complete solution without the inclusion of additional components.

### Accelerators
Accelerators are pre-built resources and tools that function end-to-end. Compared to assets, they are much closer to the final product that they might be used to build.

### Blueprints
Blueprints are used to raise the quality bar of a solution. They may focus on one of the pillars of the well-architected framework or target solution-building within a specific industry or technology field.

### Solution Guidance
Solution Guidance explains how to engage with and progress through the SBE Build Hub from Ideation to Delivery and Go-To-Market.

### Reference Architecture

Reference architecture diagrams provide examples of how solutions across a variety of use cases, industry, and technology fields are built using AWS services and SBE resources. They can be used as inspiration for building a new solution or to assist in improving the quality of an existing solution.
